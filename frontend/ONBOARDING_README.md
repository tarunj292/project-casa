# Onboarding Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a user onboarding flow for new users to collect their preferences when they first log in to the CASA app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Context Management
- **File**: `src/contexts/UserContext.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Centralized state management for user data and authentication
- **State**: 
  - `isLoggedIn`: Boolean indicating if user is authenticated
  - `isNewUser`: Boolean indicating if user needs onboarding
  - `phoneNumber`: User's phone number
  - `onboardingData`: Object containing user preferences

### 2. Onboarding Flow
- **Step 1**: `src/components/OnboardingStep1.tsx`
  - Age Range selection (Gen Z, Millennial, Other)
  - Style Interests selection (3-5 options from 8 available)
  
- **Step 2**: `src/components/OnboardingStep2.tsx`
  - Preferred Fits selection (multiple options)

- **Main Flow**: `src/pages/OnboardingPage.tsx`
  - Manages the step progression
  - Collects and stores user preferences
  - Redirects to home page after completion

### 3. Updated Components

#### LoginPopup (`src/components/LoginPopup.tsx`)
- Now integrates with UserContext
- Automatically detects new vs returning users
- Redirects new users to onboarding flow
- For demo: phone numbers containing '1234567890' are treated as existing users

#### ProfilePage (`src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`)
- Updated to use UserContext instead of local state
- Properly handles logout functionality

#### TopBar (`src/components/TopBar.tsx`)
- Updated to use UserContext for authentication state

#### App (`src/App.tsx`)
- Wrapped with UserProvider for global state management
- Added `/onboarding` route

## How to Test

### Test New User Flow:
1. Go to the app (http://localhost:5173/)
2. Click on Profile or any login-required feature
3. Enter any phone number (except ones containing '1234567890')
4. Click Continue
5. You should be redirected to the onboarding flow

### Test Returning User Flow:
1. Enter a phone number containing '1234567890'
2. Click Continue
3. You should be logged in without onboarding

### Test Onboarding Steps:
1. **Step 1**: Select age range and at least 3 style interests
2. **Step 2**: Select preferred fits
3. After completion, you'll be redirected to the home page

## Design Implementation
The onboarding screens match the provided designs with:
- Purple gradient background
- CASA branding with progress dots
- Card-based selection interface
- Proper button states and validation

## State Management
User preferences are stored in the UserContext and persist during the session. In a production app, this data would be:
- Sent to the backend API
- Stored in the user's profile
- Used for personalization and recommendations

## Future Enhancements
- Add API integration for user registration/login
- Persist user state across browser sessions
- Add more onboarding steps (size preferences, brand preferences, etc.)
- Add skip options for certain steps
- Add progress saving (allow users to complete onboarding later)
